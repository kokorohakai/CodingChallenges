This is the solution to a coding challenge I was given.
The challenge was to create a muliplication table of just prime numbers.
This is the result of that challenge.
I chose C++, as for me it just seemed to be the quickest language to use to write this specific challenge.
It was compiled in mingw, but should be compilable under any OS with g++ installed.
Simple download / clone, and then type "make".
And just so it's known, I didn't make this a main.cpp, PrimeTable.cpp, and PrimeTable.h - interface / implementation style project,
just because it's so small, that I figured it'd be easier to read in one file.

So that means the binary is a windows console executable. 
If you clone this in windows, just type "cc" to execute the result."# CodingChallenges"
