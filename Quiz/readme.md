# ProgrammingQuiz

I applied for a certain company. And after talks with that company, I was told if I answered these questions correctly, I would be brought on for an on-site interview. 

The questions are:

1. Given a one dimensional array of data, write a function that returns a new array with the data reversed. 

2. Write a quick and dirty program (not just a standalone function) to print a count of all the different words in a text file.

3. write a function that returns M random non-negative integers less than N.

4. Given a one dimensional array of data, write a function that returns M random elements of that array. Each element must also be from a different position in the array.

5. (redacted as it didn't produce a coding example)

6. Consider a directed graph of small non-negative integers, where each integer is less than 60,000.:

	- write a function that creates a node in a graph

	- write a function that inserts a node as a child of another node.

	- write a function to print out the graph

The folders are the answers to those questions. I answered the questions using C++.
I realize overall I made some mistakes.

My goal, tbh, was to get it down as quickly as possible. Which also meant doing it without much thought to the structure.
